# ClipMenuScripts
Pat Kujawa's http://www.clipmenu.com/ scripts, actions, config, etc.
Note: the download links on the main site have been broken, so there's a mirrored dmg in this repo. It might also be possible to pull builds from [naotaka/ClipMenu: A clipboard manager for Mac OS X](https://github.com/naotaka/ClipMenu).

Put this in the Resources directory, e.g. `/Applications/ClipMenu.app/Contents/Resources`.
